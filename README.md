Okay okay, so listen to this. I discovered magic. Like, really, but it doesn't use mana or anything that those silly fiction books use, its powered by static electricity!
That might sound silly, but it's real! There might be some science mumbo-jumbo to explain this, but I don't see how a wand with funny sparks can make an explosion where I
point it.

Seriously though, this is a plugin to add magic spells to your Spigot/Paper server using the sliding of various materials to generate energy! For 1.16.4.
